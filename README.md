# Fraudulent-Transaction
The goal of the project is to detect whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.
The dataset contains two-day transactions by European cardholders during September 2013.
The dataset contains 284,807 transactions out of which 492 were fraud cases
Due to the privacy reasons, the dataset has been anonymized. The feature names have also been changed (V1, V2, V3, etc.). Hence, you will not gain much insights from visualization
By the end of the project, the learners will be able to learn the approaches required for fraud modeling
